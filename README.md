# GameIndex
A script designed to do 4 things
1) Scan for ROMs in your ROM folders and create an Index by matching up their GameID with a database.
2) Gather playtime data regarding those ROMs by scanning Retroarch, PCSX2 and Dolphin log files.
3) Allow for easy renaming of romfiles without losing their link in Retroarch and Launchbox.
4) Syncronize playtimes from Emulators to Launchbox.

Make sure to download the latest verion of GameID.py for the higher speed and hitrate.
