# GameIndex
A script to manage Retroarch and Launchbox in a number of ways:
1) Scan for ROMs in your ROM folders and create an Index by matching up their GameID with a database.
2) Gather playtime data regarding those ROMs by scanning Retroarch, PCSX2 and Dolphin log files.
3) Allow for easy renaming of romfiles without losing their link in Retroarch and Launchbox.
4) Syncronize playtimes from Emulators to Launchbox.
5) Link existing pictures to the correct games.
6) Set user screenshots as Launchbox/Retroarch Gameplay pictures.
7) Copy Cover Art and GamePlay pictures between Retroarch/Launchbox


For better screenshot compression, download pngquant and place exe in same folder as script.

Downloading GameID.py can increase accuracy, but makes detection much slower and is not recommended for large libraries.
